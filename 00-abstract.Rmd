In this thesis we revisit some of the numerical methods for solving the Heston model's European call. Specifically, we approach Euler's, the Kahl-Jackel an two versions of the exact algorithm schemes. To perform this task, firstly we present a literature review which brings stochastic calculus, the Black-Scholes (BS) model and its limitations, the stochastic volatility methods and why they resolve the issues of the BS model, and the peculiarities of the numerical methods - convergence, discretization and stability. Since it is impossible to have a deep approach to all these topics, we provide recommendations when we acknowledge that the reader might need more specifics. We introduce the methods previously cited providing all our implementations in R language. Also, we deliver an R package with these functions and others.
