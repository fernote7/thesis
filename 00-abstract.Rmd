In this thesis we revisit numerical methods for the simulation of the Heston model's European call. Specifically, we study the Euler, the Kahl-Jackel an two versions of the exact algorithm schemes. To perform this task, firstly we present a literature review which brings stochastic calculus, the Black-Scholes (BS) model and its limitations, the stochastic volatility methods and why they resolve the issues of the BS model, and the peculiarities of the numerical methods - convergence, discretization and stability. We provide recommendations when we acknowledge that the reader might need more specifics and might need to dive deeper into a given topic. We introduce the methods aforementioned providing all our implementations in R language within a package.
