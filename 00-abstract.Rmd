In this thesis we revisit numerical methods for the simulation of the Heston model's European call. Specifically, we study the Euler, the Kahl-Jackel an two versions of the exact algorithm schemes. To perform this task, firstly we present a literature review which brings stochastic calculus, the Black-Scholes (BS) model and its limitations, the stochastic volatility methods and why they resolve the issues of the BS model, and the peculiarities of the numerical methods. We provide recommendations when we acknowledge that the reader might need more specifics and might need to dive deeper into a given topic. We introduce the methods aforementioned providing all our implementations in R language within a package.
