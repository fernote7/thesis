  \chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}
  
  Welcome to the \emph{R Markdown} thesis template. This template is based
  on (and in many places copied directly from) the Reed College LaTeX
  template, but hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that
  have never used TeX or LaTeX before. Using \emph{R Markdown} will also
  allow you to easily keep track of your analyses in \textbf{R} chunks of
  code, with the resulting plots and output included as well. The hope is
  this \emph{R Markdown} template gets you in the habit of doing
  reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but
  also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto
  your results down the road.
  
  Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and
  you will reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis. The use of
  LaTeX in combination with \emph{Markdown} is more consistent than the
  output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing,
  and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have
  never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going
  to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written
  before, taxing Word's capabilities. After working with \emph{Markdown}
  and \textbf{R} together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be
  your reporting style of choice going forward.
  
  \textbf{Why use it?}
  
  \emph{R Markdown} creates a simple and straightforward way to interface
  with the beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in \textbf{R} to
  work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and
  paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX,
  \emph{R Markdown} also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it
  and to visualize it using \textbf{R} functions, and also to provide the
  documentation and commentary on the results of your project. Further, it
  allows for \textbf{R} results to be passed inline to the commentary of
  your results. You'll see more on this later.
  
  \textbf{Who should use it?}
  
  Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures,
  complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance
  of their document should use \emph{R Markdown}. Of particular use should
  be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of
  \emph{Markdown} and its ability to keep track of and easily include
  figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references,
  table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone
  writing a thesis project.
  
  \chapter{Literature Review}\label{lt-review}
  
  This chapter presents the concepts of stochastic calculus, from the
  historic conception of how it first arose through the basic principles
  and applications in finance. More precisely, we address the classical
  Black-Scholes model and its limitations and the Heston model. This model
  is also well known, it introduces the concept of stochastic volatility
  which brings us closer to reality.
  
  \section{Stochastic Calculus}\label{stochastic-calculus}
  
  Stochastic calculus arises from stochastic processes and allows the
  creation of a theory of integration where both the integrand and
  integrator terms are stochastic processes. Stochastic calculus, also
  known as, Itô calculus due to the name of it's creator, the Japanese
  mathematician Kiyosi Itô in the 1940s and 1950s is used for modelling
  financial options and in another wide variety of fields (1). In this
  chapter we present the historical contexts in which the tools and models
  used arise, but our focus is introducing the concepts and notations that
  will be further used in our work.
  
  \subsection{Brownian Motion}\label{brownian-motion}
  
  The Brownian motion is the name given to the irregular motion observed
  in the motion of pollen particles suspended in fluid resulting from
  particle collision with atoms or molecules. It is named after Robert
  Brown, the first to have observed the movement in 1828. He noted two
  characteristic in the pollen movement (1):
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    the path of a givern particle is very irregular, having a tangent at
    no point
  \item
    the motion of two distinct particles appear to be independent
  \end{itemize}
  
  The first quantitative works in brownian motion come from an interest in
  stock price fluctuation by Bachelier in 1900. Albert Einstein also
  leaned over the subject and in 1905 derived the transition density for
  Brownian motion from molecular-kinectic theory of heat (1,2).
  
  In 1923, the Wiener process was coined in honor of Norbert Wiener
  mathematical proof of existence of the brownian motion.
  
  \begin{align}
    W_{0}=0 \\
    a = 3
    \label{eq:wiener}
  \end{align}
  
  \eqref{eq:wiener}.

  \chapter{Mathematics and Science}\label{math-sci}
  
  \section{Math}\label{math}
  
  \TeX~is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed
  \TeX~when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to
  finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics. One nice feature
  of \emph{R Markdown} is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.
  
  If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want
  to read the following section which has been commented out. If you're
  not going to use math, skip over or delete this next commented section.
  
  \section{Chemistry 101: Symbols}\label{chemistry-101-symbols}
  
  Chemical formulas will look best if they are not italicized. Get around
  math mode's automatic italicizing in LaTeX by using the argument
  \texttt{\$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{formula\ here\}\$}, with your formula
  inside the curly brackets. (Notice the use of the backticks here which
  enclose text that acts as code.)
  
  So, \(\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}\) is written
  \texttt{\$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Fe\_2\^{}\{2+\}Cr\_2O\_4\}\$}.
  
  \noindent Exponent or Superscript: \(\mathrm{O^-}\)
  
  \noindent Subscript: \(\mathrm{CH_4}\)
  
  To stack numbers or letters as in \(\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}}\), the subscript
  is defined first, and then the superscript is defined.
  
  \noindent Bullet: CuCl \(\bullet\) \(\mathrm{7H_{2}O}\)
  
  \noindent Delta: \(\Delta\)
  
  \noindent Reaction Arrows: \(\longrightarrow\) or
  \(\xrightarrow{solution}\)
  
  \noindent Resonance Arrows: \(\leftrightarrow\)
  
  \noindent Reversible Reaction Arrows: \(\rightleftharpoons\)
  
  \subsection{Typesetting reactions}\label{typesetting-reactions}
  
  You may wish to put your reaction in an equation environment, which
  means that LaTeX will place the reaction where it fits and will number
  the equations for you.
  
  \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{C_6H_{12}O_6  + 6O_2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{6CO_2 + 6H_2O}
    \label{eq:reaction22}
  \end{equation}
  
  We can reference this combustion of glucose reaction via Equation
  \eqref{eq:reaction22}.
  
  \subsection{Other examples of
  reactions}\label{other-examples-of-reactions}
  
  \(\mathrm{NH_4Cl_{(s)}}\) \(\rightleftharpoons\)
  \(\mathrm{NH_{3(g)}+HCl_{(g)}}\)
  
  \noindent \(\mathrm{MeCH_2Br + Mg}\) \(\xrightarrow[below]{above}\)
  \(\mathrm{MeCH_2\bullet Mg \bullet Br}\)
  
  \section{Physics}\label{physics}
  
  Many of the symbols you will need can be found on the math page
  \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/math.html} and the Comprehensive
  LaTeX Symbol Guide
  (\url{http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf}).
  
  \section{Biology}\label{biology}
  
  You will probably find the resources at
  \url{http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html} helpful, particularly
  the links to bsts for various journals. You may also be interested in
  TeXShade for nucleotide typesetting
  (\url{http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/txe.html}). Be sure to
  read the proceeding chapter on graphics and tables.
  
  \chapter{Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels}\label{ref-labels}
  
  \section{Tables}\label{tables}
  
  In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a
  data frame in \textbf{R} that you saw in {[}R Markdown Basics{]} using
  the \texttt{kable} function, you can also create tables using
  \emph{pandoc}. (More information is available at
  \url{http://pandoc.org/README.html\#tables}.) This might be useful if
  you don't have values specifically stored in \textbf{R}, but you'd like
  to display them in table form. Below is an example. Pay careful
  attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows
  and columns.
  
  \begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
  \caption{\label{tab:inher} Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents
  and Child}\tabularnewline
  \toprule
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.29\columnwidth}\centering\strut

  \end{minipage}\tabularnewline
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.29\columnwidth}\centering\strut

  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.29\columnwidth}\centering\strut

  \end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\centering\strut
  Slight\strut
  \end{minipage}\tabularnewline
  \bottomrule
  \end{longtable}
  
  We can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table
  \ref{tab:inher}. If you go back to {[}Loading and exploring data{]} and
  look at the \texttt{kable} table, we can create a reference to this max
  delays table too: Table \ref{tab:maxdelays}. The addition of the
  \texttt{(\textbackslash{}\#tab:inher)} option to the end of the table
  caption allows us to then make a reference to Table
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(tab:label)}. Note that this reference could
  appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared.
  
  \clearpage
  
  \section{Figures}\label{figures}
  
  If your thesis has a lot of figures, \emph{R Markdown} might behave
  better for you than that other word processor. One perk is that it will
  automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You'll
  also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then
  reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables
  earlier. If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and
  \emph{R Markdown} will automatically adjust the numbering for you. No
  need for you to remember! So that you don't have to get too far into
  LaTeX to do this, a couple \textbf{R} functions have been created for
  you to assist. You'll see their use below.
  
  In the \textbf{R} chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as
  \texttt{reed.jpg} in our main directory. We then give it the caption of
  ``Reed logo'', the label of ``reedlogo'', and specify that this is a
  figure. Make note of the different \textbf{R} chunk options that are
  given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).
  
  \begin{Shaded}
  \begin{Highlighting}[]
  \KeywordTok{include_graphics}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{path =} \StringTok{"figure/reed.jpg"}\NormalTok{)}
  \end{Highlighting}
  \end{Shaded}
  
  \begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=3.47in]{figure/reed} \caption{Reed logo}\label{fig:reedlogo}
  \end{figure}
  
  Here is a reference to the Reed logo: Figure \ref{fig:reedlogo}. Note
  the use of the \texttt{fig:} code here. By naming the \textbf{R} chunk
  that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as
  done in the first sentence here. We can also specify the caption for the
  figure via the R chunk option \texttt{fig.cap}.
  
  \clearpage 
  
  Below we will investigate how to save the output of an \textbf{R} plot
  and label it in a way similar to that done above. Recall the
  \texttt{flights} dataset from Chapter \ref{rmd-basics}. (Note that we've
  shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.) We will
  next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by
  airline from Portland for 2014. Note also the use of the \texttt{scale}
  parameter which is discussed on the next page.
  
  \begin{Shaded}
  \begin{Highlighting}[]
  \NormalTok{flights %>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(carrier) %>%}
  \StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mean_dep_delay =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(dep_delay)) %>%}
  \StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =} \NormalTok{carrier, }\DataTypeTok{y =} \NormalTok{mean_dep_delay)) +}
  \StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_bar}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{position =} \StringTok{"identity"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"identity"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{fill =} \StringTok{"red"}\NormalTok{)}
  \end{Highlighting}
  \end{Shaded}
  
  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{thesis_files/figure-latex/delaysboxplot-1.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:delaysboxplot}Mean Delays by Airline}
  \end{figure}
  
  Here is a reference to this image: Figure \ref{fig:delaysboxplot}.
  
  A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at
  \url{https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv}.
  
  \clearpage
  
  Next, we will explore the use of the \texttt{out.extra} chunk option,
  which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by
  specifying \texttt{"scale=\ "}. Here we use the mathematical graph
  stored in the ``subdivision.pdf'' file.
  
  \begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figure/subdivision} \caption{Subdiv. graph}\label{fig:subd}
  \end{figure}
  
  Here is a reference to this image: Figure \ref{fig:subd}. Note that
  \texttt{echo=FALSE} is specified so that the \textbf{R} code is hidden
  in the document.
  
  \textbf{More Figure Stuff}
  
  Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the
  \texttt{out.extra} chunk option. (Currently this only works in the PDF
  version of the book.)
  
  \begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[angle=180, scale=1.1]{figure/subdivision} \caption{A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down}\label{fig:subd2}
  \end{figure}
  
  As another example, here is a reference: Figure \ref{fig:subd2}.
  
  \section{Footnotes and Endnotes}\label{footnotes-and-endnotes}
  
  You might want to footnote something.\footnote{footnote text} The
  footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes
  work in much the same way. More information can be found about both on
  the CUS site or feel free to reach out to
  \href{mailto:data@reed.edu}{\nolinkurl{data@reed.edu}}.
  
  \section{Bibliographies}\label{bibliographies}
  
  Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate
  an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for
  creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). In
  addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the
  free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. The Reed librarians have
  created Zotero documentation at
  \url{http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero}. In addition, a tutorial
  is available from Middlebury College at
  \url{http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/}.
  
  \emph{R Markdown} uses \emph{pandoc} (\url{http://pandoc.org/}) to build
  its bibliographies. One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do
  a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To
  cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography
  database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede
  it by the ``at'' symbol. For example, here's a reference to a book about
  worrying: ({\textbf{???}}). This \texttt{Molina1994} entry appears in a
  file called \texttt{thesis.bib} in the \texttt{bib} folder. This
  bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX. You
  can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header
  in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the \texttt{bib}
  folder.
  
  For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site
  (\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html})\footnote{\textbf{???}}.
  There are three pages on this topic: \emph{bibtex} (which talks about
  using BibTeX, at \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html}),
  \emph{bibtexstyles} (about how to find and use the bibliography style
  that best suits your needs, at
  \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html}) and
  \emph{bibman} (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by
  hand, without BibTeX, at
  \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html}). The last page
  will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.
  
  If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can
  see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the
  appropriate csl file. You can download a variety of different style
  files at \url{https://www.zotero.org/styles}. Make sure to download the
  file into the csl folder.
  
  \textbf{Tips for Bibliographies}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your
    bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in
    source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do
    it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination.
  \item
    The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other
    entries.
  \item
    When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate
    each author's name by the word ``and'' e.g.
    \texttt{Author\ =\ \{Noble,\ Sam\ and\ Youngberg,\ Jessica\},}.
  \item
    Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager)
    accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as
    necessary.
  \item
    To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is
    generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
  \item
    You can add a Reed Thesis citation\footnote{\textbf{???}} option. The
    best way to do this is to use the phdthesis type of citation, and use
    the optional ``type'' field to enter ``Reed thesis'' or
    ``Undergraduate thesis.''
  \end{itemize}

  \chapter*{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}
  
  If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can
  add the \texttt{\{-\}} attribute.
  
  \textbf{More info}
  
  And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter
  title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are
  to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's
  obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add
  an indent there.

  hidden throughout the document (using the \texttt{include\ =\ FALSE}
  chunk tag) to help with readibility and/or setup.
  
  \textbf{In the main Rmd file}

  \CommentTok{# installed and loaded. This thesisdown package includes}
  \CommentTok{# the template files for the thesis.}
