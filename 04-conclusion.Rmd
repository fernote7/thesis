# Conclusion {-}

As we revisit what was presented through this thesis, we highlight that we were unable find codes of the heston's exact algorithm in any shape or form. That means we searched if the algorithm implementation was available in any programming language, or at least a reference to where to find it and we couldn't. 

Firstly, we provided a succint, but rigorous, theoretical framework. Since this topic is very embracing, we provided an abundant amount of literature not only to the core topics approached, but also to the marginal ones. 

Thereafter, we thoroughly introduced the algorithms we were going to implement in R,  and how we were going to do it. Four different algorithms are presented: the Euler solution, the Kahl-Jackel algorithm, and two versions of what we (and literature) call the "exact algorithm". The first trying to be as similar as possible to the one presented in Broadie-Kaya's paper and the modified version bringing an approximation to the algorithm's second step (the costlier step) as we replace the integral with a drift interpolation.
