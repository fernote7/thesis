  I would first like express my sincere appreciaton to my advisor Hugo de la Cruz for his assistance and support. Also, professor Yuri's guidance steering me to the correct path and helping when I had questions. Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends who supported me through this path.

The french mathematician Louis Bachelier was the trail-blazer that brought Brownian motion, previously restricted to the field of botanics where it was firstly observed, to the financial framework. He modeled the stock prices as a Brownian motion with drift. IN the 1950's Paul Samuelson created a model based on the Geometric Brownian Motion to price options. He and others computed paths and the expected discounted payoff of European options, but with no standard discount factor or growth rate. In 1973, Black and Scholes [@black1973pricing] designed a way to effectively calculate a European option price that became the *de facto* standard modeling strategy.

Options are derivatives that give their bearers the rights to buy or sell a specific asset in a future date and with a predetermined price. They are, by design, affected by variations in the underlying assets' components, for example, the variance. 

The Black-Scholes model was once the standard way of option pricing, but was replaced by more recent models that are now prevalent. One of the main drawbacks of the Black-Scholes model is the strong assumption that the stock returns' volatility is constant. Thus, the implied model's volatility results in a flat surface when plotted against the option's strike price and maturity. Real world implied volatility varies with the strike price and maturity, forming what is called the 'volatility smile'.

The Heston model is an extension of the Black-Scholes model that tackles this volatility issue replacing the constant volatility with a stochastic process. This model was presented by Heston in 1993 and approaches the problem introducing an efficient closed form solution to compute vanilla options, which makes this model easy to be transferred to real life pricing. Its implementations is simple when compared to its more sophisticated competitors and calibrating Heston's model, where pricing several times the same asset is required so that parameters reproducing market prices can be obtained, are easy and can be done in a short amount of time. Furthermore, this model presents a dynamic for the underlying asset which takes into account asymmetry and kurtosis, two often observed statistical moments.

We aim with this thesis to better understand the Heston model, its quirkinesses, associated numerical methods and their implementations, and eventually discuss its pros and cons. For such, we will not only discuss the challenges in a vaguely way, but show code snippets of our implementations in R programming language [@rlang] to help clarify possible associated difficulties. Furthermore, since we didn't find code for the exact algorithm implementation we intend to release a CRAN package with the codes as a didactic tool.


This thesis is divided into five chapters, the first being this introduction. Following, we have a literature review that mainly addresses stochastic calculus, the Black-Scholes models and the Heston model. Thereafter we present the different Heston  model implementations. Chapter 4 brings the results of the tests we perform and finally, chapter 5 presents the conclusion.
