The french mathematician Louis Bachelier was the trail-blazer that brought Brownian motion, previously restricted to the field of botanics where it was firstly observed, to the financial framework. He modeled the stock prices as a Brownian motion with drift. In 1973, Black and Scholes [@black1973pricing] designed a model based on the Geometric Brownian Motion to price options.

Options are derivatives that give their bearers the rights to buy or sell a specific asset in a future date and with a predetermined price. They are, by design, affected by small variations in the underlying assets' components, for example, the variance. 

The Black-Scholes model was once the standard way of option pricing, but was replaced by more modern models that are now prevalent. One of the main drawbacks of the Black-Scholes model is the strong assumption that the stock returns' volatility is constant. Thus, the implied model's volatility results in a flat surface when plotted against the option's strike price and maturity. Real world implied volatility varies with the strike price and maturity, forming what is called the 'volatility smile'.

The Heston model is an extension of the Black-Scholes model that tackles this volatility issue replacing the constant volatility with a stochastic process. There are many models that approach volatility stochastically, but the Heston has valuable characteristics such as presenting an analytical solution to the option pricing and also having a computationally simple implementation when compared to more sophisticated competitors.

We aim with this thesis to better understand the Heston model, its quirkinesses, associated numerical methods and their implementations, and eventually discuss its pros and cons. For such, we will not only discuss the challenges in a vaguely way, but show code snippets of our implementations in R programming language [@rlang] to help clarify possible associated difficulties. Furthermore, since we didn't find code for the exact algorithm implementation we intend to release a CRAN package with the codes as a didactic tool.


This thesis is divided into five chapters, the first being this introduction. Following, we have a literature review that mainly addresses stochastic calculus, the Black-Scholes models and the Heston model. Thereafter we present the different Heston  model implementations. Chapter 4 brings the results of the tests we perform and finally, chapter 5 presents the conclusion and work limitations.
